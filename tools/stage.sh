# `owfeed build` packages a DIRECTORY; it does not build one. Everything luci.mk would do on the way
# in — the install mapping, the JS minification, the version stamp, the lifecycle scripts — has to
# happen before it. The one step it does NOT do is the catalogue: owfeed compiles the .po itself,
# byte-identical to po2lmo, and requiring po2lmo would put a C build of luci-base in front of anyone
# packaging this.
#
# Why not the SDK, when tools/t2-*.sh prove an SDK build works: this package is noarch — browser JS,
# one stylesheet and a shell script, not one compiled byte — and the SDK spends about five minutes
# per format downloading and verifying a cross toolchain in order to run `cp`, twice, because 24.10
# and 25.12 are different containers. The SDK path stays as a GATE (it is what T2 exercises, and it
# is how anyone else can build this from an OpenWrt tree); nothing released comes from one.
#
# luci-app-footstrap-files/Makefile stays and is not a second source of truth: the lifecycle scripts
# are EXTRACTED from it below, so the two paths cannot disagree about what happens at install time.

# 1. luci.mk's install mapping, and only it: htdocs -> /www, root -> /. There is no ucode/ or
#    luasrc/ here; a directory that appears later and is not copied would be a package missing half
#    of itself, so the copy is explicit rather than a wildcard over the package directory.

# 2. The JS and the CSS, minified over the STAGED copy — never over the checkout.
#
#    terser, not jsmin: jsmin strips comments and whitespace only, while identifiers are wire bytes
#    and uhttpd serves /www with no compression. Measured on this tree, jsmin gets 71,650 bytes down
#    to 33,559 and terser to 29,016 — and the sheet, which csstidy is not allowed near (see
#    LUCI_MINIFY_CSS:=0 in the Makefile), goes 17,174 -> 5,149 through tools/minify-css.sh.
#
#    THIS STEP USED TO DO NOTHING AT ALL. It globbed `resources/fs-cmd*.js`, a path copied from the
#    sibling package, matched no file, and `[ -f ] || continue` swallowed it: v0.1.0 shipped all
#    three files verbatim (65,776 + 6,018 + 17,174 bytes, read back out of the released .ipk). The
#    minifiers below fail the build when they are handed nothing, which is what makes that silence
#    impossible to repeat.
#
#    The SDK path is NOT changed and still runs jsmin over the sources (LUCI_MINIFY_JS is left at
#    its default) — a buildbot has no node. The two paths therefore ship different bytes for the
#    same commit, and both are gated: tools/t0.sh parses the jsmin output, tools/minify-js.mjs
#    parses its own and refuses to write a file whose module seam it changed.
