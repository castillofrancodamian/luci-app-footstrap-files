/* Minify the VENDORED editor over the staged payload — as ES modules, never in the checkout.
 *
 *   node tools/minify-vendor.mjs dist/root/www/luci-static/resources/view/footstrap-files/vendor/pce
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT "EDITING SOMEBODY ELSE'S CODE". prism-code-editor ships its dist through rollup
 * with code-splitting and NO minifier: the files carry their JSDoc, their indentation and their line
 * breaks — 74,142 bytes of JS where terser reaches 30,219. The tree in the repository stays exactly
 * as upstream published it, which is what makes a diff against a new release readable; what ships is
 * the same code with the whitespace taken out, the way the OpenWrt buildbot treats every other
 * package's JS.
 *
 * THE MODULE SEAM IS THE WHOLE RISK, and it is checked rather than trusted. These files import each
 * other by name across 25 modules (`import { a as languages } from "./core-DEy9UQvI.js"`), so a
 * mangled export would leave a module importing a name nobody exports any more — and nothing would
 * say so until a reader opened a file on a router. Every file's import and export lists are
 * therefore compared before and after, source by source and name by name, and a file whose seam
 * moved is not written.
 *
 * `mangle.toplevel` is safe for the same reason it is safe for our own modules: a module's top level
 * is its own scope, and terser rewrites the export specifier along with the binding it renames. The
 * external half of `export { x as a }` — the `a` — is what other files import, and it survives.
 *
 * Verified on the stand with the packaged bytes: the editor opens, uci highlights, find-and-replace
 * counts its matches, and T2 passes 44/44. */
